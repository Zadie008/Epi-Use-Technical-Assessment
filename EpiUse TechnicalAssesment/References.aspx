        <h3>Design and Inspiration</h3>
        <p>
            In designing the application's user interface, I aimed to create a modern, intuitive experience that reflects the professionalism and visual identity of the EPI-USE brand. I inspected multiple EPI-USE’s corporate websites, and design language to identify recurring themes in color usage, layout, and imagery. This research informed several key design decisions:
        </p>
        <ul>
           
            <li><strong>Imagery:</strong> After doing some research, I found that EPI-USE is part of the Group Elephant, which inspired the background images of elephants and rhinos. </li>
            <li><strong>Color Palette:</strong> I noticed the company websites do not make use of much colour, but do use light blue (#6998b9) </li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Key Features and Functionality</h3>
        <p>
            The application was designed to be user-friendly, scalable, and technically robust. It showcases a range of features that demonstrate both front-end design sensibility and back-end logic:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Employee Management:</strong> Full CRUD functionality enables administrators to create, view, update, and delete employee records efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Organizational Hierarchy:</strong> A custom-built, interactive hierarchy chart visually represents reporting structures and team relationships, enhancing clarity and navigation.</li>
            <li><strong>Profile Photo Upload:</strong> Users can personalize employee profiles by uploading and updating profile images, adding a professional and human touch.</li>
            <li><strong>Search and Filtering:</strong> A dynamic search and filter system allows users to quickly locate specific employee records based on multiple criteria, improving usability and performance.</li>
        </ul>
